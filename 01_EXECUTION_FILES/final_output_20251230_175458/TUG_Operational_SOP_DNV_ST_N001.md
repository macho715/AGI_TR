## Executive Summary
This SOP defines tug-assisted procedures for stages where AFT draft is below the propulsion gate.
Operational philosophy: no reliance on main propulsion during incomplete immersion.
Control authority: tug has operational control.

## 1) Pre-RoRo Phase (T-3h to T-1h)
1. Tug deployment: minimum 2 tugs (bow + stern), 1 standby
2. Main propulsion restriction: minimum RPM/power, limited steering angle
3. Abort briefing: AFT draft below 2.50 m, bearing temp alarm, loss of thrust

## 2) RoRo / Ramp / Roll-on Phase (T0 to T+X)
1. Tug holds heading and position; LCT propulsion is emergency backup only
2. Mooring + tug for hang-up/trim change response
3. Real-time monitoring: 4-corner draft, freeboard, weather, bearing temp

## 3) Post-RoRo Phase (T+X to T+X+2h)
1. Recover AFT draft >= 2.70 m if possible (deballast/transfer)
2. Restore propulsion only after safe draft or maintain tug escort

## 4) Critical Stages Requiring Tug Assistance

- Stage 5_PreBallast: AFT=2.16 m (req 2.7 m), Freeboard(min)=1.4899999999999998 m
- Stage 6A_Critical (Opt C): AFT=2.36 m (req 2.7 m), Freeboard(min)=1.29 m

## 5) DNV-ST-N001 Compliance Checklist
- Design calculations (ballast plan, stability, trim)
- Operational procedures (this SOP)
- Monitoring requirements (draft, freeboard, weather, bearing temp)
- Load cases (critical stages documented)
- Risk assessment and mitigation (RPM limit, steering limit, tug standby)
